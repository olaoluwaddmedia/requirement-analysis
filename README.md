# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## Introduction
The Requirement Analysis Project involves documenting and analyzing requirements to build a solid foundation for software development. Learners will create a detailed blueprint for a booking management system, simulating a real-world scenario that emphasizes clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements for successful project execution.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis, also known as requirements engineering, involves the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, documenting, and validating the requirements of a software system. It aims to answer key questions such as:
    .What problem is the software trying to solve?
    .Who will use the software and how?
    .What are the system’s functional and non-functional requirements?

# Importance of Requirement Analysis in the SDLC
 1-Establishes a Clear Project Scope
 2-Improves Communication
 3-Reduces Development Costs and Time
 4-Enhances Quality and User Satisfaction
 5-Guides Design, Testing, and Maintenance

 ## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
    1. Prevents Misunderstandings and Miscommunication
       Requirement Analysis ensures that both stakeholders (clients, users, and managers) and developers share a common understanding of          the project’s goals.
    2. Saves Time and Reduces Development Costs
       Identifying and resolving requirement issues early in the SDLC is far less costly than fixing them later during coding or testing.
    3. Ensures Software Quality and User Satisfaction
       When requirements are well-defined, validated, and agreed upon, the resulting software is more likely to meet user needs and business objectives.
