# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## Introduction
The Requirement Analysis Project involves documenting and analyzing requirements to build a solid foundation for software development. Learners will create a detailed blueprint for a booking management system, simulating a real-world scenario that emphasizes clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements for successful project execution.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis, also known as requirements engineering, involves the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, documenting, and validating the requirements of a software system. It aims to answer key questions such as:
    .What problem is the software trying to solve?
    .Who will use the software and how?
    .What are the systemâ€™s functional and non-functional requirements?

# Importance of Requirement Analysis in the SDLC
 1-Establishes a Clear Project Scope
 2-Improves Communication
 3-Reduces Development Costs and Time
 4-Enhances Quality and User Satisfaction
 5-Guides Design, Testing, and Maintenance
